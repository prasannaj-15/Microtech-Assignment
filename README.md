## 1. Write code to create patterns as described below.
● Take input from user :-
1. Direction (let’s say D) : Up
- Possible inputs will be Up, Down, Left & Right.
2. Maximum number of star in a row (let’s say R) : 5
- Possible inputs will be any positive natural number.
● Based on input D=Up, R=5, create pattern as bellow

                    *
                  * * *
                * * * * *
                    *
                    *

● Based on input D=Down, R=5 create pattern as bellow

                    *
                    *
                * * * * *
                  * * *
                    *

● Based on input D=Left, R=5 create pattern as bellow


                    *
                  * *
                * * * * *
                  * *
                    *


● Based on input D=Right, R=5 create pattern as bellow


                    *
                    * *
                * * * * *
                    * *
                    *


 ##2. Write code to create patterns as described below.
You need to take an integer input and then draw the pattern according to it. Say for example
if you enter 5 then, the pattern should be like this-
                    A
                  B A B
                C B A B C
              D C B A B C D
            E D C B A B C D E

● Take input from user :-
You will take an integer input n from stdin.
● Constraints :-
1 <= n <= 26
● Output Format
Your output should be the pattern according to the input which you had entered.
